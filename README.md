# Salesforce-Inventory-Management-Integration
This project is focused on integrating Salesforce with an external inventory management API, specifically the Fake Store API. The primary objective is to automate the process of fetching and updating product data between Salesforce and the external system, as well as providing a user-friendly interface for managing inventory within Salesforce.
